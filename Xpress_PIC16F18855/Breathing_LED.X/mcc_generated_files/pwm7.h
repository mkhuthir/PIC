   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the PWM7 driver using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

   @Description
     This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for PWM7.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - 4.15.1
         Device            :  PIC16F18855
         Driver Version    :  2.00
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
         MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.40
